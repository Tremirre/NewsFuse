# NewsFuse - AI powered detector of biased/opinionated content in news articles

![nf-icon](newsfuse-ext/icons/64.png)

## What is NewsFuse?

**NewsFuse** is a chrome extension and FastAPI application that parse the news article for opinionated sentences and classifies them as biased or not biased as to help the reader to not be influenced by the author's opinion.

It highlights the result as background color of the sentence - green for unbiased and red for biased.

Additionally it allows to enter a _translation_ mode that tries to deopinionate the article by replacing the biased sentences (highlighted in yellow) with their unbiased counterparts (highlighted in purple).

## Examples

### [CNN-opinion article](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/06/08/opinions/mike-pence-true-conservatives-dreams-avlon/index.html) - bias highlight

As this is an opinion article, it is expected to have a lot of biased sentences. The extension highlights them in red. The green highlights are the sentences that are not biased - e.g.

_"Against this backdrop, on his 64th birthday, Pence officially announced his candidacy Wednesday and joined CNNâ€™s Dana Bash for a town hall in Iowa, where he tried to walk the line between continuity with the Trump administration while condemning his former running mate."_

mostly states facts and not opinion (although the last part might be considered opinionated).

On the contrary the sentence

_This is pretzel logic and worked out about as well as you might imagine for folks listening for consistency at home._

is clearly opinionated and is highlighted in red.

### [CNN-opinion article](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/06/08/opinions/mike-pence-true-conservatives-dreams-avlon/index.html) - translation

Translation only modifies the sentences that are highlighted in red - e.g. the aformentioned sentence _This pretzel logic (...)_ has been removed in its entirety as it has no factual value. Whilst a sentence

_Pence was most effective when he stopped trying to straddle the fence._

has been rewritten to more objective

_Pence demonstrated effectiveness when he stopped attempting to straddle the fence._

### [Al-jazeera news article](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2023/7/26/tottenham-owner-joe-lewis-charged-with-insider-trading-in-us) - bias highlight

Here the extension is tested on purely factual news article. As expected, most of the article is highlighted as unbiased - with the exception being direct quotes which are not yet being excluded from the parsing process.

### [Al-jazeera news article](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2023/7/26/tottenham-owner-joe-lewis-charged-with-insider-trading-in-us) - translation

The quotes detected as biased have been removed in their entirety.

## How does it work?

### Chrome extension

The chrome extension is a simple javascript application that parses the DOM of the current page and sends the text to the FastAPI application for processing. It then receives the result and highlights the biased sentences.

### FastAPI application

The FastAPI application is a simple REST API that receives the text corpus from the chrome extension, splits it to sentences with [nltk](https://www.nltk.org/) and sends it to pretrained BERT classifier.

The classifier is a simple transformer with a linear layer on top of it, trained on [MBIC](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/timospinde/mbic-a-media-bias-annotation-dataset) dataset. It uses [preprocessing layer](https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/bert_en_uncased_preprocess/3) and small [BERT model](https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/small_bert/bert_en_uncased_L-8_H-128_A-2/2) from [TensorFlow Hub](https://tfhub.dev/).

After the classification, the FastAPI application sends the result back to the chrome extension in form of sentence-classification pairs.

The translation mode is implemented by replacing the biased sentences with their unbiased counterparts using LLM (Large Language Model) via API, however due to restrictions of the model the quality of translations varies heavily.

## Controls

![controls](readme_pictures/nf-client.png)

The extension has the following controls:

- **Parse Paragraphs** - finds all paragraphs in the current page and parses them for biased sentences. Using this button will work only on the first time the page is loaded, to parse the page again (e.g. in translation mode), the page has to be reloaded.
- **Enter/Leave Grabber Mode** - allows to select a text on the page and parse it for biased sentences.
- **Highlight Text** - hides/shows the highlights of biased/translated sentences.
- **Translate** - changes the mode to translation mode. In this mode, the biased sentences are replaced with their unbiased counterparts.

## Limitations

- The extension is not yet published on Chrome Web Store, so it has to be installed manually and the FastAPI application has to be run locally.
- The extension does not yet support direct quotes, so they are being parsed as any other sentence.
- Reported speech is sometimes being incorrectly classified as biased.
- Highlighting engine has some issues with highlighting sentences that contain HTML tags and might omit some of the sentences or highlight them incorrectly.

## Running locally

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Tensorflow classification model (a pretrained one is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cU0Y-lWfqsXk_QwkfplDZwAtwg-vOGwQ/view?usp=sharing))

### Steps

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Tremirre/NewsFuse.git
   ```

2. Create and activate virtual environment in the newsfuse-func directory
   ```bash
    cd newsfuse-func
    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies

   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Export the environment variable `MODEL_PATH` with a path to your exported tensorflow model (a pretrained one is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cU0Y-lWfqsXk_QwkfplDZwAtwg-vOGwQ/view?usp=sharing)).

   ```bash
   export MODEL_PATH=<your-path>
   ```

5. Preprare environment variables for your API of choice:

- For **Google Vertex AI** API - Export environment variables `API_USED` as "google", `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` with credentials to your Vertex AI credentials JSON file and `GOOGLE_LOCATION` with the location that is to be used for the Gemini model (e.g., "europe-central2")

  ```bash
  export API_USED=google
  export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=<your-path-to-credentials>
  export GOOGLE_LOCATION=<your-desired-location>
  ```

- For **OpenAI** API - Export the environment variables `API_USED` as "openai" and `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your api key.
  ```bash
  export API_USED=openai
  export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
  ```

6. Run the FastAPI application

   ```bash
   uvicorn app:app
   ```

7. Add the extension to Chrome

   - Open Chrome
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable `Developer mode`
   - Click `Load unpacked`
   - Select `NewsFuse/newsfuse-ext` folder

8. Open any news article and click `Parse Paragraphs` button

9. Enjoy!
